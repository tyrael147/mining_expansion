# Supplementary Information

##Information

This repository contains de required code for models construction and the generation of figures associated with publication: `A machine learning approach to understand how accessibility influences alluvial gold mining expansion in the Peruvian Amazon'. The models presented can be visualized in [[link]](https://glarrea.users.earthengine.app/view/miningarticle)

## Usage

For running data processing, random forest model training and visualization:  
- To run .js scripts it is required to have a Google Earth Engine account [ [link] ](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). 
- Copy the code in the programming panel and run.
For generating figures presented in the paper: 
- Jupyter notebooks contain the steps and procedures of the whole experimentation, import the repository in a google Colab session [ [link] ](https://colab.research.google.com/) to avoid dependancy issues.
- A Google Drive verification step is requiered for exporting and downloading.
